Sam,

I'm not sure if you already have a utility that does this or not,
but I wrote an ISPF macro that swaps the variables around an
equal sign.

Example:

screen_var = database_var

becomes

database_var = screen_var

To use it, assign the macro to a PF key, put the cursor on the
line that needs to be swapped and press the PF key.  The change
is made and the cursor drops down to the next line ready for
another change.

I use it when writing PL/1 programs that interface with ISPF
panels.  I tested it with PL/1 and FORTRAN syntax in the ISPF
editor and CA-PANVALET.

If you don't already have something that does this on your tape,
feel free to include it.  I've attached the macro in an ascii
text file.

Thanks,
Dave
